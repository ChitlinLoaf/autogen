    "# Using Gemini in AutoGen with Other LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install AutoGen with Gemini features.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen[gemini]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the process of using Gemini in AutoGen with many other tools. We will use the following dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen[gemini,retrievechat,lmm]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "You don't need to handle OpenAI or Google's GenAI packages. AutoGen already handled all of these for you.\n",
    "You can just create different agents with different backend LLM with assistant agent, and all models/agents are at your fingertip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Distinctions\n",
    "- Gemini does not have the \"system_message\" field yet. However, you can add this instruction to the first message."

      "1. **Image Capture:** Users can capture images using the device's camera or import existing images.\n",
      "2. **Gemini Model**: The pipeline processes the image through Gemini, a multimodal deep learning model, to extract object detection and localization information.\n",
      "3. **Object Recognition**: Gemini identifies the objects present in the image and assigns labels to them (e.g., \"person,\" \"chair,\" \"cup\").\n",
      "4. **Spatial Localization**: Gemini determines the location of each object within the image, providing detailed spatial coordinates.\n",

      "**Multimodal Interface:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Audio Feedback:** The product provides verbal descriptions of the image, including the objects it contains and their locations. Users can listen to these descriptions through headphones or speakers.\n",
      "* **Haptic Feedback:** For users with limited hearing, the product offers haptic feedback through a combination of vibrations and gestures.\n",
      "* **Tactile Display:** For users who are blind or have low vision, the product can interface with a Braille display or other tactile devices to provide descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Scene Understanding:** Allows users to understand complex visual scenes, such as describing the layout of a room or the contents of a grocery store shelf.\n",
